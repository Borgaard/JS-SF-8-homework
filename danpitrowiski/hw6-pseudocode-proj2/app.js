// I want to build an onboarding experience to Reddit where you can click into interesting subreddits and see some example content. Then you can click a button to add it as a favorite or not.

// Intialize with the proper credentials

// Login to Reddit

// Wait for user to click on the category sureddit they want to explore.

// After a user clicks, record the ID which will be equal to the subreddit they clicked on. Call a function to retrieve 25 posts from reddit's trending. I want to focuse on only photo driven subreddits.
