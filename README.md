How To Use This Repo
--------------------

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.    
Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/code``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```JS-SF-8-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name. Example: ```JS-SF-8-homework/Sasha-svodnik```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's github name. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your named directory. Example for homework #2: `JS-SF-8-homework/Sasha-svodnik/hw_2/hubot.js`

Example of how your local homework directory should be structured:


    |-- code/
        |-- JS-SF-8-resources/ (cloned from Github)
        |-- JS-SF-8-homework/ (cloned from Github)
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- hw_1/
                    |- bottlesOfBeer.js
                    |- randAddressGenerator.js
                |-- hw_2/
                    |- hubot.js
                |-- hw_3/
                |-- hw_4/
                |-- hw_5/
